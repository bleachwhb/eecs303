[05/30 11:43:04     8s]                   Welcome to Cadence Encounter(R) RTL Compiler
[05/30 11:43:04     8s] 
[05/30 11:43:04     8s] Here is a quick introduction on how to access our product information.  
[05/30 11:43:04     8s] If you do not want this message to appear in the future, create an 
[05/30 11:43:04     8s] initialization file (an empty file will do) in your home directory 
[05/30 11:43:04     8s] called '~/.cadence/.synth_init'.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s] 
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   To access the product documentation in HTML and PDF, type 'cdnshelp'
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]     at the system prompt. 
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   For a list of available commands, type 'help'. 
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   To view a man page for a command, type 'man <commandName>'.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   To view a man page for an error message, type 'man <messageID>'.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   For a list of all possible object types, type 'get_attribute -help'.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   For a list of all available attributes by object type, type
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]     'get_attribute * <object_type> -help'.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   For a list of all attributes for every object type, type
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]     'get_attribute * * -help'
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   To list only writable attributes, substitute 'get_attribute' with
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]     'set_attribute'.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   To get a template script to run RTL Compiler, use the 'write_template'
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]     command.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   To get a template script to run Conformal based on the current RTL
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]     Compiler session, use the 'write_do_lec' command.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   Obsolete attributes in the current tool version.
[05/30 11:43:04     8s]   To learn more, type 'get_attribute -help <attribute> <object>'.
